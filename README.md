# Getting Started with Create React App

This is a Quizdom Interview project

## Description

Technical Assignment

1. Project: Weather App
   To help the world plan for the future, you decide to build a
   weather forecast application. The application should allow
   users to view the current weather, an hourly forecast for the
   next 5 hours and a 5-day weather forecast, for Athens. You
   decide to use React.js (you can use CRA). Your main target is
   users on their smart phone (Android / iOS).
2. Minimal functionality

- The user must be able to see the current weather for Athens
- The user must be able to see the weather forecast for the next
  5 hours for Athens
- The user must be able to see a 5-day weather forecast for
  Athens

3. Deliverables

- The project with the source code, resource files and any thirdparty libraries used
- A short explanation of you design choices
- Anything extra you would have done given more time
- Anything else you feel we should know

4. Additional information and suggestions

- You don’t have to impress by adding much on top of the point
  2 “Minimal functionality”, what we look at foremost is your
  engineering and coding skills (clean, well executed code).
  Equally important are best practice development techniques,
  good look and feel and usability (keep UI/UX in mind). And
  lastly your approach on solving problems.
- When you develop the app only focus at the very last firmware
  and devices on the market.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs all the dependencies

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
